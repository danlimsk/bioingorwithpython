This directory contains the code examples extracted from my book
Bioinformatics Programming Using Python, published by O'Reilly Media,
2010. Examples from the book that do not define functions are omitted
from these files, as are brief definitions shown inline with the text.

I will be adding more material to this web site in the coming months.  There
may also be unit tests for some of the code examples that go beyond the simple
demonstrations  in the "main" part of most of these files.  In addition, I plan
to add exercises and perhaps eventually some more extensive examples than those
in the book.

Errata for the book are found at
http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=9780596154516.
Please add any other errors you find.
