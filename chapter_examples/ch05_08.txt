### Example 5-8: Referencing a subclass class value

# DNASequence('ATTCTGGC')
#     -->  DNASequence.__init__('ATTCTGGC')
#          --> BaseSequence.__init__('ATTCTGGC')
#              --> BaseSequence.isinvalid('ATTCTGGC')
#                     which references self.ValidChars
#                          1. does self have a ValidChars field? no
#                          2. does self's class have a ValidChars field? yes
#                          [3. if it did not, the superclass of self's class 
#                               would be examined for a ValidChars field]
